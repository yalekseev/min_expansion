Given a set of integral numbers (e.g. [2, 3, 7, 10]) and a positive number
(e.g. 22) min_expand() expands the given integer into the base numbers so
that the sum of coefficients is minimum.

For example, 22 can be expanded into [2, 3, 7, 10] in the following ways:

[11, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 2]
[4, 0, 2, 0]
...

But the expansion [1, 0, 0, 2] uses minimum number of coefficients (3).
